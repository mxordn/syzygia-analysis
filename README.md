# *Syzygia* analysis
Analysing vertical soundings in scores

## Introduction
The repository contains the datasets and software used to analyse vertical sounds in motets from Johann Hermann Schein and Heinrich Sch√ºtz.

The PleiadesMusicae.py is a python module for musical analysis based on the music21 toolkit, that generates datasets of a given corpus.

The idea of analysing vertical sounds was inspired by treatises of the early 17th century, where a classification of sounds (the *syzygiae*) is developed. The name of the module, PleiadesMusicae is derived from a treatise by Henrichs Baryphonus.
